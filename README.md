Introduction to TradingBot project

Overview:

This project is meant to see which Deep Neural Networks is better as a predictive AI. 
We have chosen two cryptocurrenciesâ€™ data as crypto is very volatile. We are limiting to just Bitcoin and Ethereum data due to the limitations of training since we are doing everything locally. 
The overall thought of this project is to implement couple Deep Neural Networks, then compare their outputs. Finally, combine the Deep Neural Networks into one model and compare the combined model output.

This project is built in modularity:

Step 1: Data Collections

We are utilizing Yahoo Finance to gather the data 

Step 2: Data preprocessing

Building couple methods to clean, normalize and preprocess the data

Step 3: Building the models

Future work: Will connect the Models to a live trading view to see if the models actually performed well or not
